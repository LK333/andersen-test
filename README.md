## About The Task

There is a page with a list of messages and a form, which asks a user to fill in the fields. Name, email and message fields are required.
The form sends this information to the database called 'laravel' into the table 'messages'. Each record has its own id.
After adding a new row to the database, the user will be redirected to the main page with updated data.

Please notice:
- For creating a database write in terminal: php artisan migrate
- Homepage: '/'
- There is no any special style in the project. If it's needed, I can add it.
- Email validation is not working correctly at this moment, but I am going to find an answer what I did wrongly.
